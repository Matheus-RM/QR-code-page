## My process

### Built with

- HTML and CSS

### What I learned

Initially I thought that it would be difficult to set the github icon in the right place, but I found this to be quite easy, so I am proud of these lines.

```css
.github-link {
	...
	position: absolute;
	right: 25px;
	top: 5px;
  ...
}
```

### Continued development

In my next projects I would like to improve some animations and hover effects, and also learn more about responsive pages.

### Useful resources

- [MDN web docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Tutorials) - These tutorials have really helped me with the basics, and I think they're a great learning resource.
